# RectangleGUI
using a JavaFX GUI the program calculates the area and perimeter when given a length and a width.

  this project required me to learn how to use SceneBuilder and JavaFX. the hurtle that i ran into was getting the fxml project to import correctly, but after getting that fixed it went smoothly. to finish the project I used Exception handling to make sure the user put the correct data type in the textFields. I also learned how to properly use ImageView
